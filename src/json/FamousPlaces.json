It was later conquered by the Portuguese, and then Marathas. In 1733, the Marathas, led by Chimaji Appa, seized the fort from the Portuguese.\n The fort has been the venue for the 'Sounds of the Sufi' music festival, which is held every year in the month of February, since 2010. The festival is organised by the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) to promote tourism in the city. The festival has performances by Sufi singers and qawwals, and also has food stalls.",
